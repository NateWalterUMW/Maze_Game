To play the game: Debug --> Mappy Project.exe

I built this game using 3 2D platforming levels I built using the Mappy Tile Editor, which serve as the maps for the mazes. I built the game using C++ and C in Visual Studio with the Allegro game library. It involves 2D sprite animations, collision detection, timers and loading multiple levels.
